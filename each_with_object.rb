=begin
This method iterates over each key-value pair and
creates a new hash with the object passed into #each_with_object.
So, the block variable a (for accumulator) gets assigned to an empty hash, 
which is then built up according to set rules.

  hash = { a: 1, b: 2 }
  puts "hash = #{hash}"

   newHash[key] = value + 1
